## Welcome!

This site shares some of my projects related to dairy nutrition, sustainability, and education research. See the links above for some ways to contact me. I'd love to hear from you.

## About Me

**I am committed to helping dairies (and dairy communities) thrive.** In over a decade of experience in applied dairy nutrition, I studied protein utilization, nutrient efficiency, and environmental stewardship. I worked with stakeholders across livestock industries to build human capacity through education and extension. As an academic, I led nutrition trials, participatory on-farm research, and multi-institutional extension work that engaged dairy producers, advisors, and processors. I secured competitive funding to support innovations in the measurement methods and social structures supporting sustainable livestock production. In recent work, I am continuing to explore and appreciate the power of ruminants in productive, sustainable agroecosystems.

**I believe knowledge is meant to be shared and acted on.** A central part of my mission is translating complex research into actionable tools and resources. I have developed interactive educational materials including an open-source textbook and an R package for nutritional modeling. These tools make advanced concepts accessible to students, consultants, and producers alike. I have taught and mentored hundreds of students in diverse disciplines from animal science, computer science and engineering, receiving recognition through national and campus-wide teaching awards.

**I love working with people, animals, and data.** Throughout my career, I have sought to better understand the human, animal, and technological aspects of livestock systems. I am passionate about learning through any means - whether it is science, statistics, or stories.

## Background & Education

🌼 **Postdoctoral Associate, University of Minnesota, 2023-2025**

In my postdoc work with Erin Cortus, we evaluated laboratory methods for estimating emissions from stored manure, characterized uncertainty in barn- and pen-scale manure output measurements, and proposed a new conceptual framework for researching livestock systems sustainability. Throughout my postdoc, I worked closely with dairy stakeholders in the U.S. Upper Midwest to characterize their perceptions of environmental stewardship assessments and understand how feeding management affects productivity and sustainability.

🦡 **Ph.D., Dairy Science, University of Wisconsin--Madison, 2023**

My dissertation had two parts: 1) protein nutrition of lactating dairy cows, and 2) undergraduate education in animal & dairy sciences. Additionally, I collaborated on whole-farm sustainability assessments of farms in Quebec and Peru. I was Instructor-of-Record for *Introduction to Animal Agriculture* laboratories and co-taught *Food Systems & Sustainability* and *Animal Agriculture & Sustainable Development* with my mentor Michel Wattiaux.

🚂 **M.S., Animal Sciences, Purdue University, 2019**

During my Master's degree, I took courses related both to Animal Sciences and Educational Psychology. Working with Liz Karcher, we redesigned the *Introduction to Animal Agriculture* lectures and laboratories to promote student engagement. I also developed and evaluated an integrated-STEM poultry education module, working with the poultry industry and high school classrooms across Indiana (499 students in 23 classrooms). See my publications and presentations to learn more about these massive course (re)design efforts!

**🚂 B.S., Animal Sciences, Purdue University, 2017**

Dairy nutrition captured my interest from the start. As an undergraduate, I was fortunate to work with Tamilee Nennich Adolph and Shawn Donkin. Projects included tests of calf water intake on different planes of nutrition, and refinement of a glucose tolerance test protocol.

**🐄 P.A.S., Dairy Science, American Registry of Professional Animal Scientists, 2017**
