                  Milk-derived microRNAs (miRNAs) have attracted increasing attention due to their involvement in regulation of biological processes. However, the degree to which these molecules are conserved in infant formulas remains unclear. Herein, a high-throughput small RNA sequencing was performed to reveal the profile of miRNAs from camel milk, buffalo milk, and commercial infant formulas. Compared with raw milk, infant formulas exhibited significant reductions in miRNA diversity and abundance. Camel and buffalo milk were enriched in development- and immune-related miRNAs, comprising let-7, miR-2887, miR-2904, and miR-1246, whereas formulas reserved limited subsets at lower levels. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that raw milk–derived miRNAs were involved in immune-associated pathways, signifying conserved functions in immune regulation across species. Although both camel and buffalo milk display immunological significance through miRNA-facilitated gene regulation, camel milk miRNAs seem to target a broader spectrum of pathways, including those involved in cellular interactions and viral defense. Furthermore, protein–protein interaction analysis for the highly expressed miRNA targets identified central regulatory hubs such as HLA, LILRB1, LIN28B, and TUT4, involved in RNA processing, immunity, and stem cell maintenance. This study could offer a molecular foundation to support the expansion of next-generation infant formulas that more effectively retain functional RNA components of raw milk.

However, the degree to which these molecules are conserved in infant formulas remains unclear. Herein, a high-throughput small RNA sequencing was performed to reveal the profile of miRNAs from camel milk, buffalo milk, and commercial infant formulas. Compared with raw milk, infant formulas exhibited significant reductions in miRNA diversity and abundance. Camel and buffalo milk were enriched in development- and immune-related miRNAs, comprising let-7 , miR-2887 , miR-2904 , and miR-1246 , whereas formulas reserved limited subsets at lower levels. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that raw milk–derived miRNAs were involved in immune-associated pathways, signifying conserved functions in immune regulation across species. Although both camel and buffalo milk display immunological significance through miRNA-facilitated gene regulation, camel milk miRNAs seem to target a broader spectrum of pathways, including those involved in cellular interactions and viral defense. Furthermore, protein–protein interaction analysis for the highly expressed miRNA targets identified central regulatory hubs such as HLA , LILRB1 , LIN28B , and TUT4 , involved in RNA processing, immunity, and stem cell maintenance. This study could offer a molecular foundation to support the expansion of next-generation infant formulas that more effectively retain functional RNA components of raw milk.   Key words microRNAs  raw milk  infant formula  small RNA sequencing  functional enrichment analysis    INTRODUCTION In addition to its essential role in providing nutrition, milk is considered a functional bioactive fluid, containing higher levels of regulatory molecules that have the ability to influence newborn development (Gregg et al., 2022 ; Szyller et al., 2024 ). Among these molecules, microRNAs (miRNAs ), small noncoding RNA involved in post-transcriptional genes regulation, have attracted increasing attention due to their functional role in metabolic programming, immune modulation, and cellular differentiation (Słyk-Gulewska et al., 2023 ; Xue et al., 2023 ). Allowing them to resist enzymatic degradation and potentially employ systemic functions in the targeted tissues, miRNAs are naturally encapsulated in the milk-derived extracellular vesicles (Bai et al., 2025 ). Human milk has been broadly investigated for its miRNA profile (Xi et al., 2016 ; Liao et al., 2017 ; Carrillo-Lozano et al., 2020 ; Kim and Yi, 2020 ); however, the profiles of miRNAs in other milk species, such as camel and buffalo milk, which are extensively consumed in countless areas and recognized for their exceptional therapeutic and nutritional aspects, remain unclear. Various miRNAs that are plentiful in milk could potentially affect numerous functions. For instance, miR-21  has been reported to regulate gut maturation and immunity, miR-29b  could affect neurogenesis and regulate epigenetics, miR-182–5p  is involved in immunity and metabolism, and miR-148  could affect epigenetics and metabolism. Moreover, the let-7  group is signified by various subcategories in milk and is known to be involved in several processes, such as metabolism, neurogenesis, and immunity (Leroux et al., 2021 ). Infant formulas are designed to closely mimic the nutritional profile of human milk (Logeshwaran et al., 2020 ); however, they undergo intensive processing stages such as pasteurization, spray-drying, and storage, that may compromise the integrity of bioactive components such as miRNAs (Colella, 2021 ). The biological equivalence of breast-fed contrasted with formula-fed infants remains a matter of ongoing debate (Caroli et al., 2021 ; Slater et al., 2024 ), mainly regarding the immunological and epigenetic programming facilitated by milk-derived miRNAs. To bridge this knowledge gap, comparative studies are needed to evaluate the abundance, diversity, and functionality of miRNAs among natural milk and processed dairy products. To assess their functional potential and guide developments in infant formula design, it is also necessary to understand the extent to which miRNAs are conserved or lost in infant formulas. Leiferman et al. (2019)  reported that 221 miRNAs were identified in 3 human milk samples, among which 84 miRNAs were common in all samples. Conversely, miRNAs were not detected in infant formulas. Another study evaluated expression of 5 immunoregulatory miRNAs in human milk compared with infant formulas (Vélez-Ixta et al., 2022 ). Relative expression levels of miRNAs were comparable among milk samples, and infant formulas displayed very low levels of these miRNAs. Similarly, infant formulas showed very low levels of miR-148a  and miR-125b  compared with human milk (Chiba et al., 2022 ). In the present work, a high-throughput small RNA sequencing analysis was performed to reveal the profile of miRNAs from raw camel milk, buffalo milk, and 4 different commercial cow milk–based infant formula powders. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide a comprehensive analysis of miRNA profiles in raw milk (camel and buffalo) compared with different infant formulas.  MATERIALS AND METHODS Collection of Milk Samples and Infant Formulas Fresh raw camel and buffalo milk samples were collected from a local dairy supplier in Al Ain City, United Arab Emirates. The present study was accomplished within the normal handling animals' procedures approved by dairy farms. All valid established regulations for the use and care of animals were considered. The milk sample collection process followed routine methods and was out of the scope of Directive 2010/63/EU (article 1 5.f, “Practices not likely to cause pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm equivalent to, or higher than, that caused by the introduction of a needle in accordance with good veterinary practice”). Milk samples were collected under cooled conditions and immediately transferred to the laboratory and kept at −80°C until analysis. In addition, 4 different brands of cow milk–based infant formulas for ages 0 to 6 mo were procured from a local market. All chemicals and reagents were of high purity and analytical grade.  Extraction of RNA from Raw Milk and Infant Formulas To prepare the sample, 10 mL of each of the raw milk samples was added to 50-mL centrifuge tubes. For infant formulas, 5 g of the powder was mixed with 7 mL of 1× PBS and vortexed. Then, debris and fat were removed by centrifugation for 15 min at 3,000 × g  and 4°C, and the fat layer floating at the top of the tube was carefully removed. The cell pellet was resuspended in 5 to 10 mL of RNase-free PBS, followed by a second centrifugation for 15 min at 3,000 × g  and 4°C. The PBS was then removed, and the final cell pellet was retained. Cell lysis with Trizol was performed by adding 1 mL of Trizol to the pellet, followed by incubation in a water bath at 70°C for 5 min. The tube containing Trizol (1:5 ratio of Trizol volume) was thoroughly mixed with 200 µL of chloroform and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. The clear aqueous phase was carefully transferred to a new tube by using a 200-µL pipette, avoiding contamination. Afterward, 500 µL of isopropanol (1:1 ratio to aqueous phase) was added and gently mixed by inverting to precipitate RNA pellets by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. To wash RNA pellets, the supernatant was cautiously discarded, and 600 µL of ethanol (70%) was added and gently inverted to wash the pellet, followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 12,000 rpm and 4°C. The supernatant was entirely discarded, and the pellets were air-dried for ∼5 min. Finally, 55 µL of RNase-free water was added to dissolve and elute the RNA.  Library Preparation and Quality Control For sample quality control, the concentration of RNA from each sample was determined by using Quant-iT RiboGreen RNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen, cat. no. R11490) and VICTOR Nivo Multimode Microplate Reader (PerkinElmer, part no. HH35000500). Furthermore, a 4200 TapeStation System (Agilent, part no. G2991BA) was applied to evaluate the quality. The RNA isolated from each sample was also used to construct sequencing libraries with the SMARTer smRNA-Seq Kit for Illumina, following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, input RNA is first polyadenylated to provide a priming sequence for an oligo-(dT) primer. cDNA synthesis was primed by the 3′ smRNA dT primer, which includes an adapter sequence at the 5′ end of each first-strand cDNA molecule. When the MMLV-derived PrimeScript reverse transcriptase (RT ) reaches the 5′ end of each RNA template, it adds non-templated nucleotides, which are bound by the SMART smRNA, oligo-enhanced with locked nucleic acid (LNA) technology for greater sensitivity. In the template-switching step, PrimeScript RT uses the SMART smRNA Oligo as a template for the addition of a second adapter sequence to the 3′ end of each first-strand cDNA molecule. In the next step, full-length Illumina adapters (including index sequences for sample multiplexing) are added during PCR amplification. The forward PCR primer binds to the sequence added by the SMART smRNA Oligo, whereas the reverse PCR primer binds to the sequence added by the 3′ smRNA dT primer. The resulting library cDNA molecules include sequences required for clustering on an Illumina flow cell. The libraries were validated by checking the size, purity, and concentration on the Agilent Bioanalyzer. Furthermore, the libraries were pooled in equimolar amounts and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeqX (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA) instrument. In addition, image decomposition and quality value calculations were accomplished by using the modules of the Illumina pipeline.  Adapter Trimming To eliminate adapter sequences, the raw reads of small RNAs were pre-processed. Adapters in the raw reads were trimmed using the Cutadapt program (Martin, 2011 ). The first 3 nucleotides of all reads were trimmed to remove extra bases, which were inserted during the SMART template-switching process. If a sequence was matched to more than the first 5 base pairs (bp) of the 3′ adapter sequence, it was considered as an adapter sequence and then trimmed from the read. Trimmed reads, whose lengths were longer than 18 bp, were selected for mapping reliability. Then, the remaining reads were classified into non-adapter reads, whose adapter sequences were not sequenced. In this analysis, trimmed and non-adapter reads were combined and regarded as processed reads for downstream analysis.  Clustering and Ribosomal RNA Filtering To minimize sequence redundancy for computational efficiency, processed reads were clustered by a sequence. A unique cluster consists of the reads whose sequences and lengths are same. To eliminate rRNA, reads were excluded that aligned to 45S pre-rRNA and mitochondrial rRNA. These filtering operations were performed only on Bos taurus .  Quantification of Mature miRNA Abundances Sequence alignment and detection of known and novel miRNAs were performed using miRDeep2 software algorithm (Friedländer et al., 2012 ). rRNA-filtered or adapter-trimmed reads were aligned to the matured and precursor miRNAs of B. taurus , obtained from miRBase v22.1 (Kozomara and Griffiths-Jones, 2014 ) using the miRDeep2 quantifier module. The miRDeep2 algorithm is based on the miRNA biogenesis model; it aligns reads to potential hairpin structures to check whether their mapping context is consistent with Dicer processing and assigns scores representing the probability that hairpins are true miRNA precursors. The reference genome of B. taurus  (ARS-UCD1.2) was retrieved from RefSeq. The reference genome was indexed, and rRNA-filtered or adapter trimmed reads were mapped to it using Bowtie (1.1.2) according to Langmead (2009) . Novel miRNAs were predicted from the mature, star, and loop sequences according to the RNAfold algorithm using miRDeep2. The RNAfold function uses the nearest-neighbor thermodynamic model to predict the minimum free-energy secondary structure of an RNA sequence. Then, uniquely clustered reads were sequentially aligned to the reference genome, miRBase v22.1, and noncoding RNA database RNAcentral release 14.0 (RNAcentral Consortium, 2017 ) to identify known miRNAs and other types of RNA for classification. Processed reads from other species samples were aligned to the matured and precursor miRNAs of each species obtained from miRBase v22.1 (Robinson et al., 2010 ) using the miRDeep2 quantifier module.  Functional Enrichment Analysis The highly expressed miRNAs from each sample were selected based on normalized read counts obtained from small RNA sequencing. The selected miRNAs were subjected to target gene prediction by using miRWalk, TargetScan, and miRTarBase, prioritizing experimentally validated interactions and conserved seed matches. Target genes of the selected miRNAs were analyzed for pathway enrichment using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG ) database. Furthermore, Gene Ontology (GO ) enrichment analysis was performed by using the clusterProfiler package in R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing), applying a hypergeometric test to identify significantly overrepresented pathways. The analysis was accomplished by using the DAVID and clusterProfiler tools, applying Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple testing. All visualizations were created by using Matplotlib and Seaborn in Python. Gene network construction based on protein–protein interactions was performed using STRING software (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes, https://string-db.org/ ).   RESULTS Extraction of RNA from Raw Milk and Infant Formulas Although the biological nature of the pellet differs between raw milk and infant formula, the consistent extraction protocol enables a comparative assessment of extractable RNA. The observed reduction in formula sample reflects a depletion of miRNAs associated with insoluble components, rather than a direct loss of cellular RNA. The samples and library quality control metrics for RNA extracted from raw camel milk, buffalo milk, and infant formulas are shown in Supplemental File S1 (Table S1, see Notes), highlighting the comparative yield of RNA and sequencing readiness across the 6 samples. Under extraction conditions, miRNAs associated with somatic cells in raw milk were not detectable in infant formula aggregates, likely to reflect differences in sample composition and processing. Results show that camel and buffalo milk samples yielded measurable concentrations of RNA, accounting for 1.006 and 1.976 ng/µL, respectively, with total RNA amounts sufficient for library preparation (0.050 and 0.059 µg, respectively). The camel milk library showed a typical small RNA size of 176 bp and a concentration of 0.54 ng/µL (5.12 nM ), representing successful enrichment of miRNAs, whereas the buffalo milk library showed a typical small RNA size of 184 bp and a concentration of 4.81 ng/µL (40.23 nM ). Conversely, infant formulas showed variable but, in some cases, considerable RNA yield. Formula 1 displayed 20.418 ng/µL RNA and a library size of 172 bp (3.62 ng/µL, 32.42 nM ); formula 2 had 8.564 ng/µL RNA with a 177 bp library (4.4 ng/µL, 38.27 nM ); and formula 3 exhibited the highest RNA concentration (60.687 ng/µL) and a 174-bp library (2.74 ng/µL, 24.21 nM ); whereas formula 4 had the lowest RNA yield (1.735 ng/µL) and a 169 bp library (0.57 ng/µL, 5.21 nM ).  Raw Data and Trimming Data Statistics The total number of bases, reads, percentage of guanine and cytosine bases, Q20 (%), and Q30 (%) were calculated (Supplemental File S1, Table S2, see Notes). In camel milk, 69,775,367 reads were produced, and the total read bases were 3.6 gigabase pairs. The percentage of guanine and cytosine bases was 42.57%, and Q30 was 92.22%. Furthermore, the reads start at the first base after the 5′ sequencing adapter and in Illumina sequencing typically end after 51 bp (in case of sequencing 51 bp SE). As mature miRNAs are normally up to 25 bp in length, the reads will contain part of a 3′ adapter sequence that has to be removed. According to these criteria, the sequenced reads were categorized as trimmed reads, non-adapter reads, short reads, and low-quality reads. The adapter trimming process was performed to eliminate the adapter sequences that exist in the read using Cutadapt. If a read matches at least the first 5 bp of the 3′ adapter sequence, it is considered as an adapter sequence and then trimmed from the read. To be considered reliable for analysis, trimmed reads should be a minimum of 18 bp. Afterward, the 3′ end of each read was quality trimmed with −q 10 in Cutadapt. Further, trimmed or non-adapter reads with N base were regarded as low-quality and filtered. In the case of the SMARTer Small RNA library, an additional 3 bp base was generated during the reverse transcription process on the 5′ of read 1, so the process of trimming that base was included. The statistics of trimmed, non-adapter, and short FASTQ in the different samples are summarized in Supplemental File S1, Table S2. In case of analyzing a short target (<50 bp), the trimmed reads as processed reads were used. Otherwise, in case of analyzing a long target (≥50 bp), both the trimmed reads and non-adapter reads as processed reads were used. In this analysis, both short targets and long targets were analyzed to get a comprehensive miRNA profile. Table 1   represents counts for trimmed reads, non-adapter reads, short reads, and low-quality reads by each sample. The results show that a total of 69,775,367 reads were produced from camel milk, of which 45,540,509 reads included the adapter, and the read length after trim was 18 bp or more. Furthermore, 1,202,187 reads did not include the adapter, and 22,945,181 reads were shorter than 18 bp after adapter trim. For the analysis of long targets, 46,742,696 readings were used in the subsequent analysis, including trimmed reads and non-adapter reads. The read length distribution of each sample is shown in Figure 1  . Generally, mature miRNAs are 20 to 25 nucleotides in length.  Quantification of Mature MiRNA Abundance The quantification step was divided into 3 procedures. First, mature miRNA sequences of relevant species were aligned to precursor miRNA sequences from miRBase v22.1 (bowtie option: –f –v 0 –a–best–strata–norc). In the second step, unique clustered reads were aligned to the precursor sequence (bowtie option: –f –v 1 –a–best–strata–norc). Bowtie aligner was used in the mapping steps. In the third step, the overlapping mature miRNA regions between 2 mapping results were determined. Subsequently, the read count of mature miRNAs was extracted from the overlapping regions in the miRDeep2 Quantifier module. If a read is mapped to multiple mature miRNAs, the read counts are assigned equally to the abundance level of each mature miRNA. Table 2   shows the number of mapped reads to miRBase mature miRNAs. The mapped reads in the 6 samples were 172,205, 152,884, 1,302, 1,425, 139, and 726 for camel milk, buffalo milk, formula 1, formula 2, formula 3, and formula 4, respectively. The numbers of known mature miRNAs with read counts more than 1, 5, and 10 for each sample are also presented in Table 2 . The results revealed that camel and buffalo milk displayed higher numbers of the detected known miRNAs compared with the 4 types of infant formulas. Supplemental File S2 (see Notes) presents the expression profile of miRBase precursor for each sample in read counts. High-throughput sequencing of small RNAs from raw milk and infant formulas exposed distinct miRNAs expression profiles. Camel milk was enriched in let-7b , miR-2887 , let-7a , and miR-2904 , whereas buffalo milk displayed high expressions of miR-2887 , miR-1246 , miR-2904 , and let-7  family. Infant formulas retained some conserved miRNAs, such as let-7b  family, miR-2887 , and miR-2904 , but with lower read counts and reduced diversity. A core set of miRNAs was shared across all the samples, comprising species of the let-7  family and miR-21 , signifying conserved regulatory roles in mammal milk. However, each sample also displayed a unique miRNA signature. Camel milk contained exclusive miRNAs such as miR-1246  and miR-191 , which are associated with immune modulation and epithelial integrity (Deveci et al., 2023 ; Wang et al., 2025a ). Buffalo milk uniquely expressed miR-29b , miR-141 , and miR-200c , linked to oxidative stress response and epithelial development (Johansson et al., 2021 ; Saha, 2024 ). Infant formulas had fewer unique miRNAs, and those detected were generally of lower abundance. A heatmap of the major miRNAs across all samples (Supplemental File S1, Figure S1) highlights the clustering of natural milk species (camel and buffalo) based on their high expression of let-7 , miR-2887 , and miR-2904 . In contrast, infant formulas formed a separate cluster, reflecting their distinctive and less diverse miRNA profiles. The expression profile according to the known mature miRNAs is presented in Supplemental File S3 (see Notes). Supplemental Figure S2 (see Notes) also presents a heatmap of the reads per million (RPM ) values of the top miRNAs among the different samples. The comparative analysis of mature miRNA expression profiles showed dissimilar patterns across raw milk and infant formula samples. The predominant 10 miRNAs in each sample type were identified according to the RPM values. Remarkably, let-7  family, miR-1246 , and miR-2887  were consistently among the most expressed across natural milk species and infant formulas. Camel milk displayed an exclusive enrichment of miR-1246  and miR-191 , whereas buffalo milk exhibited higher levels of miR-1246  and let-7 . Conversely, infant formulas showed variable miRNA profiles, with some overlapping with raw milk, but also a different signature; for instance, elevated miR-574  in formula 3 and miR-7865  in formula 4.  KEGG Pathway Enrichment Analysis The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis was performed using the highly expressed miRNAs from each sample. Figure 2   reveals the top enriched pathways per sample, with bubble size signifying the number of target genes and color representing statistical significance according to the false discovery rate (−log10  of false discovery rate). Each sample showed unique miRNAs, indicating species-definite or formulation-explicit effects. The biological functions of genes targeted by miRNAs identified in raw camel and buffalo milk were explored by KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. Both data sets showed enrichment in immune-associated pathways, signifying conserved functions in immune regulation across species. Three main pathways, including natural killer cell–facilitated cytotoxicity, antigen presentation and processing, and graft-versus-host disease, were consistently enriched in both camel and buffalo milk miRNA targets. These pathways are central to adaptive and innate immune responses, indicating that milk-derived miRNAs may be involved in immune regulation in the newborn (Ahlberg et al., 2023 ). The analysis of camel milk–derived miRNAs showed additional enriched pathways, such as Kaposi sarcoma–associated herpesvirus infection and cell adhesion molecules. These pathways indicate wider cell signaling and antiviral activities for camel milk–derived miRNAs. In addition, buffalo milk–derived miRNA targets exhibited a more focused enrichment pattern, limited to the 3 shared immune pathways. Although both milk species displayed immunological significance through miRNA-facilitated gene regulation, camel milk miRNAs seemed to target a broader spectrum of pathways, including those involved in cellular interactions and viral defense. Hence, these variations may reflect nutritional characteristics of milk or species-specific adaptation during early development. Regarding infant formula–derived miRNAs, the results show dominant signaling pathways comparable to those of raw milk, but with frequently lower gene counts and enrichment scores, indicating a more limited functional assortment. The comparative analysis shows that, whereas infant formula 1 was enriched in antiviral and immune pathways, infant formulas 2 through 4 exhibited increasing emphasis on cancer-linked and signaling pathways, with infant formula 3 showing the most wide-ranging oncogenic outline. The variations among infant formulas may reflect differences in the formulation approaches and could have consequences for cellular programming and early-life immune regulation.  GO Enrichment Analysis The GO enrichment analysis was performed to explore the biological functions associated with the highly expressed miRNAs. Top GO entries were classified according to biological process (Figure 3  ), molecular function (Figure 4  ), and cellular component (Figure 5  ). miRNAs from both camel milk and buffalo milk displayed enrichment in immune and developmental activities, comprising axon extension regulation, cell migration positive regulation, T cell activation negative regulation, cytokine production regulation, and cell–cell adhesion. These pathways indicate that milk-derived miRNAs may be involved in immune modulation, neural development, and tissue remodeling in the newborn (Melnik et al., 2021 ; Hatmal et al., 2022 ). The miRNAs in infant formula 1 were enriched in neurodevelopmental functions, such as neuron projection morphogenesis, synapse organization, axonogenesis, and nervous system development regulation. This profile suggests a potential role in brain maturation and neuronal connectivity, probably imitating some bioactivities of natural milk (Freiría-Martínez et al., 2023 ). Furthermore, miRNAs in infant formula 2 were related to RNA processing and chromatin-associated processes, such as gene silencing by RNA interference, mRNA catabolic process, and point centromere assembly. This finding indicates an emphasis on epigenetic control and post-transcriptional regulation, which may influence gene expression dynamics throughout early development. It was also shown that miRNAs from formula 3 targeted functions associated with stem cell and cell cycle biology including G1/S transition of mitotic cell cycle, differentiation of stem cells, apoptotic process negative regulation, and cell proliferation regulation. This profile suggests potential involvement in tissue renewal, developmental programming, and growth regulation (Shenoy and Blelloch, 2014 ). In addition, infant formula 4 exhibited a more focused enrichment in signaling-associated functions, such as Ras protein signal transduction, intracellular signal transduction regulation, and the MAPK cascade. These findings are fundamental to cellular communication, growth, and stress activities, signifying a functional role in development and metabolic signaling. The GO enrichment analysis highlights diverse biological processes for miRNAs among raw milk and infant formulas. In addition, natural milk (camel and buffalo) miRNAs were enriched in immune and developmental functions, whereas infant formulas displayed a specialized profile, ranging from neurodevelopment (formula 1) and RNA regulation (formula 2) to cell cycle control (formula 3) and signal transduction (formula 4). The observed variations may reflect the biological complexity of natural mammal milk contrasted with the targeted formulation approaches of infant nutrition products. The GO enrichment analysis was conducted to identify the molecular functions related to miRNA target genes from camel milk, buffalo milk, and commercial infant formulas (Figure 4 ). The results show diverse molecular profiles reflecting the functional potential of each sample. Camel milk miRNAs were enriched in immune-correlated molecular functions, comprising MHC class II receptor activity, MHC protein complex binding, natural killer cell receptor binding, and antigen binding. These findings indicate a fundamental role in immune recognition, antigen presentation, and adaptive immunity, in line with the well-known immunological properties of camel milk (Ciccarese et al., 2019 ; Behrouz et al., 2022 ). The miRNAs from buffalo milk exhibited comparable immune-related enrichment, such as natural killer cell receptor binding, MHC protein complex binding, and antigen binding. The overlap with camel milk supports the hypothesis that miRNAs form natural milk contribute to immune system modulation in early life (Melnik et al., 2014 ; Verma et al., 2022 ). The miRNAs from infant formula 1 were enriched in transcriptional and epigenetic regulatory functions, such as histone methyltransferase activity (H3-K27 specific) and transcription factor activity (RNA polymerase II proximal promoter sequence-specific DNA binding). These profiles indicate a role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation, potentially affecting developmental gene networks. The results also show that infant formula 2 miRNAs targeted RNA-correlated and nucleic acid binding processes, such as regulatory region DNA binding, double-stranded RNA binding, and RNA helicase activity. This result signifies connection to gene silencing, transcriptional control, and RNA processing, in line with its biological function enrichment in RNA interference (Arora et al., 2013 ; Treiber et al., 2019 ). The miRNAs from infant formula 3 were enriched in enzyme controlling functions, such as cysteine-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity associated with apoptotic process and other functions related to enzyme regulation and inhibition. These profiles indicate roles in cell survival, programmed cell death, and protease activity modulation, supporting its enrichment in stem cell and cell cycle pathways. Infant formula 4 miRNAs were involved in signaling-correlated molecular functions, such as GTPase activity, and other signal transduction and enzyme regulation–associated activities. This reinforces its KEGG and biological function enrichment in Ras/MAPK signaling, representing a role in stress response and cellular communication. The GO enrichment analysis was accomplished for cellular components across raw milk and infant formula samples to describe the subcellular localization of miRNA-controlled gene products (Figure 5 ). The results show discrete enrichment patterns, indicating the potential functional compartments and molecular context affected by miRNAs in each sample. Camel milk–derived miRNAs showed enrichment in components involved in vesicular transport and immune signaling, such as the external side of the plasma membrane, MHC class I protein complex, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER ) to Golgi transport vesicle membrane. These profiles reflect roles in antigen presentation, membrane-related signaling, and protein trafficking, in line with camel milk's immunological profile (Wang et al., 2025b ). Buffalo milk–derived miRNAs were enriched in ribosomal and immune components, including preribosome, U2-type spliceosomal complex, and external side of plasma membrane. This suggests inclusion in immune gene reorganization, membrane signaling, and ribosome biogenesis, supporting the role of buffalo milk in immune and developmental regulation (Kittur et al., 2025 ). Furthermore, infant formula 1 miRNAs were enriched in components associated with cellular growth and immune signaling, such as MHC class I protein complex, site of polarized growth, and ER to Golgi transport vesicle membrane. These profiles advocate an imitation of the immune functions of natural milk, with added importance on vesicle-facilitated transport and cell polarity. The results also show that infant formula 2 miRNAs targeted proteasomal and cytoplasmic components, such as the proteasome accessory complex PA700/19S regulatory subcomplex and other cytoplasmic components. This profile suggests an emphasis on RNA processing, protein degradation, and cytoplasmic regulation, in line with its molecular activity enrichment in RNA helicase and binding functions. miRNAs from infant formula 3 showed enrichment in nuclear and chromatin-related components, including cyclin-dependent protein kinase holoenzyme complex, chromatin, and nucleoplasm. These findings reflect involvement in gene expression, epigenetic control cell, and cycle regulation, consistent with its biological process enrichment in apoptosis regulation and stem cell differentiation. Finally, infant formula 4 displayed a singular enrichment in plasma membrane. This profile may indicate a more focused role in membrane-related signaling, aligning with its enrichment in Ras and MAPK signaling pathways.  Protein–Protein Interaction Network of Target Genes from Top MiRNAs To clarify the functional profiles regulated by the major miRNAs among camel milk, buffalo milk, and infant formulas, a protein–protein interaction network was constructed based on validated target genes of the highly expressed miRNAs identified across all samples. Based on their highest RPM values, the following miRNAs were selected, indicating their dominant expression profiles: let-7b , miR-1246 , let-7a-5p , miR-7865 , let-7c , miR-2904 , miR-2478 , miR-29b , let-7f , and miR-574 . The resulting network (Figure 6  ) showed a highly interconnected architecture, including significant regulatory proteins intricate in various cellular processes. The protein–protein interaction network for camel milk–derived miRNA targets was characterized by 2 main clusters, with dense interconnectivity among proteins involved in immune regulation (e.g., HLA -F , HLA-G , and LILRB1 ) and miRNA biogenesis and stem cell regulation (e.g., LIN28B  and TUT4 ). This structure reinforces the roles of camel milk in antigen performance, immune tolerance, and developmental programming (Khan et al., 2021 ; Jayamanna Mohottige et al., 2025 ), in line with its KEGG and GO enrichment in immune and signaling pathways. Buffalo milk's protein–protein interaction network includes proteins such as ULBP1 /3, MICA/B , NCR2 , and KLRD1 , which are considered as ligands and receptors involved in natural killer cell activation (Boneva et al., 2025 ), and LIN28B  and TUT4 , which control stem cell maintenance and RNA processing (Heo et al., 2009 ). This network indicates robust importance to post-transcriptional regulation, innate immune surveillance, and stress response, consistent with the immune-associated KEGG and GO profiles of buffalo milk. The protein–protein interaction network in infant formula 1 is dominated by immune-associated proteins, comprising HLA  class I molecules (HLA-B , -C , -E , -F , and -G ), KIR  and NKG2  family receptors, LILR  family members, and CD8B2 . This dense immune cluster reflects the KEGG enrichment in NK cell cytotoxicity, antigen presentation, and autoimmune pathways, signifying that infant formula 1 miRNAs may mimic some of the immunomodulatory functions of natural milk. In infant formula 2, the network features proteins such as TRIM71 , HMGA2 , and LIN28B , which regulate RNA stability, chromatin structure, and stem cell pluripotency (Yin et al., 2016 ; Parisi et al., 2020 ). This network indicates a focus on epigenetic regulation, RNA interference, and developmental timing, aligning with GO enrichment analysis in gene silencing, RNA binding, and helicase activity. Infant formula 3, the network is positioned around apoptosis regulators and cell cycle, comprising MYB , MCL1 , CCND3 , E2F1 , and CDC25A  (Engeland, 2022 ). These proteins form firmly connected clusters intricate in G1/S transition, apoptotic regulation, and stem cell differentiation, supporting the role of infant formulas in growth regulation and tissues renewal. The network in infant formula 4 underscores oncogenic and signaling proteins, including HRAS , NRAS , MYC , KRAS , LIN28A , IGF1R , HMGA2 , and ARID3B  (Wang et al., 2016 ). These interactions indicate a strong focus on transcriptional regulation, Ras/MAPK signaling, and growth factor pathways, in line with KEGG enrichment in autophagy, signal transduction, and cancer-related pathways.   DISCUSSION The present research provides an inclusive comparison of miRNA expression profiles in raw milk and commercial infant formulas, revealing both preserved and divergent outlines that reflect species-specific lactation biology and industrial processing effects. Several miRNAs, such as members of the let-7  group, miR-1246 , and miR-2887 , were consistently detected across all samples. These miRNAs are known to regulate cell proliferation, immune responses, and developmental pathways (Tüfekci et al., 2014 ; Harrandah et al., 2018 ; Letafati et al., 2022 ), signifying conserved functional role in milk-derived miRNA profiles. The presence of these species in both natural and processed dairy products underlines their potential significance in newborn nutrition and development. Camel and buffalo milk exhibited distinct miRNA profiles; camel milk was enriched in miR-2887 , miR-2904 , and miR-1246 , which have been concerned in anti-inflammatory responses, metabolic regulation, and epithelial integrity. This aligns with the reputed therapeutic aspects of camel milk, particularly in metabolic and autoimmune disorders (Behrouz et al., 2022 ; Arain et al., 2023 ; Sharma et al., 2025 ). The high expressions of miR-1246 , miR-29b , miR-141 , and miR-200c  in buffalo milk support its nutritional richness and potential roles in early immune programming (Kittur et al., 2025 ). Moreover, the depleted miRNA contents in infant formulas may be attributed to the effects of processing steps, which may eliminate or break down miRNA molecules (Zempleni et al., 2017 ; Cemali et al., 2025 ). This decline raises questions about the biological equivalence of breast-fed versus formula-fed infants, mainly regarding milk miRNA-mediated epigenetic and immunological programming. The functional implications of the variation of miRNAs were further supported by KEGG and GO enrichment analysis. Camel and buffalo milk–derived miRNAs were enriched in pathways related to immune signaling, cellular interactions, and viral defense, aligning with the acknowledged immunomodulatory and therapeutic characteristics of these milk species. Conversely, infant formulas displayed reduced and more variable enrichment, with antiviral, immune cancer–linked and signaling pathways, indicating that bioactive regulatory potential of milk miRNAs is considerably compromised in the processed infant formulas. Moreover, protein–protein interaction network analyses of the top miRNA targets showed central regulatory hubs, comprising LIN28B  and TUT4 , which control stem cell maintenance and RNA processing. The incidence of these targets in milk samples but not in formulas further highlights the systemic regulatory potential of milk-derived miRNAs and their potential role in determining newborn development. Despite their detection in infant formulas, the limited abundance and diversity of miRNAs raise concerns about the ability of commercial infant formulas to imitate the full spectrum of biological functions offered by human milk. This is primarily relevant given that miRNAs are stable under severe conditions and given their encapsulation within milk extracellular vesicles, facilitating systemic delivery and efficient uptake by the targeted tissue. Furthermore, species-definite miRNAs profiles are emphasized, with camel milk typically enriched in let-7 , miR-2887 , and miR-2904 , and buffalo milk in miR-2887 , miR-1246 , and miR-2904 . These miRNAs are involved in epithelial-supportive, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective activities, signifying that raw milk may provide different developmental benefits. The clustering of raw milk in expression heatmaps, which are different from formulas, further supports the idea of biologically coherent miRNA composition in milk. Although this study offers an extensive analysis of miRNA profiles in raw camel and buffalo milk compared with different commercial infant formula powders, certain methodological limitations must be acknowledged. Precisely, extraction, characterization, or RNase protection assays specific to extracellular vesicles were not conducted. Hence, the presence, integrity, and encapsulation status of milk-derived miRNAs within extracellular vesicles remain unverified in our data set. This restricts our ability to conclusively attribute the observed stability and functionality of miRNAs to protection and delivery mediated by extracellular vesicles. In addition, due to limited resources, nanoparticle tracking analysis, transmission electron microscopy, or immunoblotting for standard extracellular vesicles markers were not determined. These analyses would have provided direct evidence of extracellular vesicles' presence and structural integrity, particularly in processed infant formulas, where vesicle disruption is likely. Despite these constraints, the results of the study provide valuable insight into the varying abundances and functional potentials of miRNAs across diverse milk types.  CONCLUSIONS The present study provides a comprehensive comparison of the miRNA profiles from raw milk and different brands of commercial infant formula powders, showing considerable depletion of functionally and nutritionally relevant miRNAs in infant formulas. The results revealed that the detected known mature miRNAs included 163, 273, 93, 90, 30, and 12 in camel milk, buffalo milk, formula 1, formula 2, formula 3, and formula 4, respectively. The enrichment of immune- and development-associated miRNAs in camel and buffalo milk, in addition to their contribution to conserved antiviral, immunological, and cell-interaction pathways, highlights their potential implication in early-life programming. Furthermore, network analysis showed crucial regulatory hubs, such as HLA , LILRB1 , LIN28B , and TUT4 , which may be involved in several processes, including RNA processing, immune regulation, and stem cell maintenance, yet are mainly absent in infant formulas. Overall, this study underscores an urgent necessity for next-generation infant formulas that preserve the functional potential and structural integrity of milk-derived miRNAs, thus narrowing the immunological and developmental gap between breast-fed and formula-fed infants. We acknowledge that the RNA extracted from raw milk somatic cells represents cellular miRNAs, whereas infant formula lacks viable cells and extracellular vesicles due to processing. Accordingly, the observed differences reflect variations in sample composition and processing, rather than direct depletion of equivalent miRNA sources. We recommend future work to include extracellular vesicle-specific isolation and characterization to further refine these comparisons.
