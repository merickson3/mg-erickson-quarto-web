    "section": "",
    "text": "Few studies have examined the N kinetics of individual feeds with stable isotope tracing. We hypothesized that N partitioning to milk and excreta pools as well as the rates of the processes that drive this partitioning would differ for alfalfa silage, corn silage, corn grain, and soybean meal. Feed ingredients were endogenously labeled with 15N and included in 4 diets to create treatments with the same dietary composition and different labeled feed. Diets were fed to 12 late-lactation dairy cows for 4 d (96 h) and feces, urine, and milk collection proceeded during the 4 d of 15N enrichment and for 3 d (80 h) after cessation of label feeding. Nonlinear models of 15N enrichment and decay were fit to milk (MN), urine (UN), and fecal N (FN) in R with the nlme package, and feed-specific parameter estimates were compared. The estimated proportions of feed N that were excreted in feces supported our understanding that N from soybean meal and corn grain is more digestible than N from alfalfa and corn silage. Estimates for the N partitioning between milk and urine from the 2 concentrate feeds (soybean meal and corn grain) indicated that UN/MN ratios were less than or equal to 1:1, indicating either more or equal nitrogen partitioning to milk compared with urine. It is important to maintain factual accuracy in representing the results rather than implying a desired outcome unsupported by the data. In contrast, UN/MN ratios for forage feeds (corn and alfalfa silage) were {}1:1, indicating more N partitioning to urine than milk. The modeled proportion of total FN that originated from feed N was 82.2%, which is in line with previous research using a similar 15N measurement timeframe. However, the proportion of urinary and MN originating from feed N was much lower (60.5% for urine, 57.9% for milk), suggesting that approximately 40% of urinary and MN directly originate from body N sources related to protein turnover."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Reducing dietary crude protein (CP) is a well-established means to improve N use efficiency. Yet, few studies have considered if transient restrictions in dietary CP could reduce the environmental footprint of late lactation cows. We hypothesized that the effects of CP feeding pattern on digestibility and environmental outputs would be amplified at lower dietary CP. We tested CP levels below and near predicted requirements (LP, 13.8%; HP, 15.5%) offered in 2 feeding patterns: where diets alternated \\(\\pm\\) 1.8 percentage units CP every 2 d (oscillating; OF) or remained static (SF). Our study used a 2x2 factorial design with 16 mid- to late-lactation Holsteins (M = 128, SD = 12 DIM), divided into rumen-cannulated (n = 8) and non-cannulated subsets (n = 8). For each 28-d experimental period, we recorded feed intake and milk production and took samples of orts (1x/d) and milk (2x/d) for 4 d. For the cannulated subset, we measured and sampled from the total mass of feces and urine production and collected plasma 2x/d across 4 d. For the non-cannulated subset, we sampled carbon dioxide and methane emissions 3x/d for 4 d. For each subset, we fit linear mixed models with fixed effects for CP level, CP feeding pattern, the interaction of CP level and CP feeding pattern, period, and a random effect for cow. For plasma and urinary urea-N, we conducted time series analysis. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found no evidence that dietary CP level and CP feeding pattern interacted to influence N balance, nutrient digestibility, or gas emissions. Results showed HP resulted in similar milk N but increased manure N, reducing N use efficiency (milk true protein N/intake N) relative to LP. For OF, urea-N in urine and plasma peaked 46–52 h after the first higher-CP phase feeding. Nutrient digestibility and gas emissions were similar across treatments, except CO2 production was greater for OF-HP. In summary, measured variables were minimally affected by dietary CP alternating \\(\\pm\\) 1.8 percentage units every 48 h, even when average dietary CP was fed below predicted requirements (LP). Although our findings suggest that mid- to late-lactation cows are resilient to oscillation in dietary CP, oscillating CP neither reduced the environmental footprint by improving nutrient use efficiencies nor reduced the potential for direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions."

    "title": "Assessing the impact of oscillating dietary crude protein on the stability of the rumen microbiome in dairy cattle",
    "section": "",
    "text": "IntroductionUnderstanding how the rumen microbiota responds to varying protein levels and feeding patterns is critical for optimizing dairy cattle nutrition. This study investigated the influence of dietary crude protein (CP) levels (13.8% or 15.5% CP of ration dry matter) and CP feeding patterns (constant over time (static) or oscillating by 1.8 percentage units above and below the mean every 48 h) on the composition, diversity, and function of the rumen microbiome.MethodsUsing a replicated Latin Square design, eight rumen-cannulated Holstein cows were assigned each of the four dietary treatments (structured as a 2 × 2 factorial) in four consecutive 28-day periods (with 24 days of adaptation and 4 days of sampling). Rumen samples were collected 4 h post-feeding, and amplicon libraries of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene were sequenced and analyzed to assess changes in microbiome composition. Additionally, volatile fatty acids (VFAs) were measured to evaluate rumen microbial function.ResultsResults indicated that dietary CP level did not alter microbial diversity (p = 0.30), but oscillating diets increased rumen microbial diversity (Shannon index, p = 0.04). The rumen microbiome richness was also affected by CP feeding pattern (p = 0.05), but not dietary CP level (p = 0.27). Furthermore, differential abundance analysis using ANCOM-BC identified CAG- 352 (p = 0.0001) and an unclassified member of the family Acholeplasmataceae (p = 0.0002) as taxa significantly impacted by protein level and feeding pattern, even though their relative abundance was low (below 0.02%). The functional profile of the rumen bacterial communities was not affected by CP level or feeding pattern, and VFA profiles also remained consistent across treatments, with no observable changes in concentration.DiscussionThese findings support the hypothesis that the rumen microbiome remains stable despite variations in the ruminal supply of dietary CP, suggesting that compensatory mechanisms may be involved. Although oscillating dietary CP concentration might alter the rumen microbiome, further research into rumen metabolic processes and host-microbiome interactions is needed to evaluate if the changes observed in our study are biologically relevant for developing new opportunities to enhance protein nutrition in dairy cattle."

    "text": "Limited research has examined the interaction between dietary crude protein (CP) level and CP feeding pattern. We tested CP level (low protein [LP], 13.8%; high protein [HP], 15.5% CP, dry matter [DM] basis) and CP feeding pattern (OF = oscillating, SF = static) using a 2 × 2 factorial in 16 mid- to late-lactation Holsteins (initially 128 \\(\\pm\\) 12 d in milk; mean \\(\\pm\\) SD). Cows ate total mixed rations formulated by exchanging soy hulls and ground corn with solvent soybean meal to keep constant ratios of neutral detergent fiber to starch (1.18:1), rumen-degradable protein to CP (0.61:1), and forage-to-concentrate (1.5:1) in DM. The OF treatments alternated diets every 48 h to vary CP above and below the mean CP level (OF-LP = 13.8% \\(\\pm\\) 1.8%; OF-HP = 15.5% \\(\\pm\\) 1.8% CP [DM basis]) whereas diets were constant in SF (SF-LP = 13.8%; SF-HP = 15.5% CP [DM basis]). In four 28-d periods, 8 rumen-cannulated and 8 noncannulated cows formed 2 Latin rectangles. On d 25 to 28 of each period, each cow’s feed intake and milk production were recorded, and samples were taken of orts (1×/d) and milk (2×/d). We fit linear mixed models with fixed CP level, CP feeding pattern, and period effects, and a random intercept for cow, computing least squares means and standard errors. Neither CP level, CP feeding pattern, nor the interaction affected DM intake, feed efficiency, or production of milk, fat- and protein-corrected milk (FPCM), fat, true protein, or lactose. Milk urea-N (MUN) yield was lesser for LP. The LP and OF conditions decreased MUN concentration. The CP level tended to interact with CP feeding pattern so that milk protein concentration was greatest for OF-HP. The OF and LP conditions increased the ratio of true protein to MUN yield. Within OF, cosinor mixed models of selected variables showed that cows maintained production of FPCM across dietary changes, but MUN followed a wave-pattern at a 2-d delay relative to dietary changes. A tendency for lesser MUN with OF contradicted prior research and suggested potential differences in urea-N metabolism between OF and SF. Results showed that cows maintained production of economically-relevant components regardless of CP feeding pattern and CP level. Contrary to our hypothesis, the effects of 48-h oscillating CP were mostly consistent across CP levels, suggesting that productivity is resilient to patterned variation in dietary CP over time even when average CP supply is low (13.8% of DM) and despite 48 h restrictions at 12.2% CP."

Groups of five to seven students were assigned learning activities as treatments in a Latin Square design consisting of three experimental periods. At the beginning of selected laboratory sessions, students completed 10 minutes of the experimental activity immediately followed by a questionnaire. Students rated hands-on, problem-based laboratory stations as more challenging, novel, and attention-grabbing than they rated case studies or video lectures. Interest, intrinsic motivation, and behavioral engagement were greatest for groups completing laboratory stations followed by those completing case studies and lectures, respectively. Overall, the greater situational interest experienced during laboratory stations and case studies indicates that these activities can be leveraged to create learning environments that promote interest, engagement, and achievement."

    "text": "About Me\nI am committed to helping dairies (and dairy communities) thrive. In over a decade of experience in applied dairy nutrition, I studied protein utilization, nutrient efficiency, and environmental stewardship. I worked with stakeholders across livestock industries to build human capacity through education and extension. As an academic, I led nutrition trials, participatory on-farm research, and multi-institutional extension work that engaged dairy producers, advisors, and processors. I secured competitive funding to support innovations in the measurement methods and social structures supporting sustainable livestock production. In recent work, I am continuing to explore and appreciate the power of ruminants in productive, sustainable agroecosystems.\nI believe knowledge is meant to be shared and acted on. A central part of my mission is translating complex research into actionable tools and resources. I have developed interactive educational materials including an open-source textbook and an R package for nutritional modeling. These tools make advanced concepts accessible to students, consultants, and producers alike. I have taught and mentored hundreds of students in diverse disciplines from animal science, computer science and engineering, receiving recognition through national and campus-wide teaching awards.\nI love working with people, animals, and data. Throughout my career, I have sought to better understand the human, animal, and technological aspects of livestock systems. I am passionate about learning through any means - whether it is science, statistics, or stories."

    "text": "Background & Education\n🌼 Postdoctoral Associate, University of Minnesota, 2023-2025\nIn my postdoc work with Erin Cortus, we evaluated laboratory methods for estimating emissions from stored manure, characterized uncertainty in barn- and pen-scale manure output measurements, and proposed a new conceptual framework for researching livestock systems sustainability. Throughout my postdoc, I worked closely with dairy stakeholders in the U.S. Upper Midwest to characterize their perceptions of environmental stewardship assessments and understand how feeding management affects productivity and sustainability.\n🦡 Ph.D., Dairy Science, University of Wisconsin–Madison, 2023\nMy dissertation had two parts: 1) protein nutrition of lactating dairy cows, and 2) undergraduate education in animal & dairy sciences. Additionally, I collaborated on whole-farm sustainability assessments of farms in Quebec and Peru. I was Instructor-of-Record for Introduction to Animal Agriculture laboratories and co-taught Food Systems & Sustainability and Animal Agriculture & Sustainable Development with my mentor Michel Wattiaux.\n🚂 M.S., Animal Sciences, Purdue University, 2019\nDuring my Master’s degree, I took courses related both to Animal Sciences and Educational Psychology. Working with Liz Karcher, we redesigned the Introduction to Animal Agriculture lectures and laboratories to promote student engagement. I also developed and evaluated an integrated-STEM poultry education module, working with the poultry industry and high school classrooms across Indiana (499 students in 23 classrooms). See my publications and presentations to learn more about these massive course (re)design efforts!\n🚂 B.S., Animal Sciences, Purdue University, 2017\nDairy nutrition captured my interest from the start. As an undergraduate, I was fortunate to work with Tamilee Nennich Adolph and Shawn Donkin. Projects included tests of calf water intake on different planes of nutrition, and refinement of a glucose tolerance test protocol.\n🐄 P.A.S., Dairy Science, American Registry of Professional Animal Scientists, 2017"

    "section": "",
    "text": "In 2019 a global pandemic forced biology teaching laboratories to move remotely. In this article we present data on student perceptions of laboratory instruction modality as experienced pre-, during, and post-pandemic. Our research took place at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2022. We designed a survey to evaluate students’ perception of key components of scientific critical thinking set as learning outcomes of the laboratory of an introductory biology course. Participants included students who took the course under the same teaching assistant. We surveyed four consecutive semesters in which teaching and learning environments were drastically altered: A) pre-pandemic in-person instruction Fall 2019, B) pandemic emergency-remote instruction Spring 2020, C) pandemic full-semester online instruction Fall 2020, and D) post-pandemic return to in-person instruction Spring 2021. We found differences in the response to four of the nine survey items. First, greater ratings were observed for D (post-pandemic in-person Spring 2021) relative to C (pandemic full-semester online Fall 2020) for the following three items: (a) developing research questions and hypotheses, (b) performing experiments and (c) level of engagement. Furthermore, the rating for the overall laboratory quality was greater for D (post-pandemic in-person Spring 2021) relative to A (pre-pandemic in-person Fall 2019). There were no differences in students’ perception for the following four items: presenting data, performing statistical analysis, discussion of results, and acquiring critical thinking skills. We concluded that students had a better appreciation for in-person laboratories after experiencing remote laboratory. In the future, student perceptions should be considered, along with their academic experiences, whenever laboratory teaching is done remotely."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Using manure as a crop fertilizer promotes recycling of locally available organic nutrients and reduces needs for manufactured inorganic fertilizers. However, the factors that motivate and constrain manure use are unclear. To explore stakeholder perceptions, we designed a quantitative survey assessing potential benefits and barriers to manure use, knowledge of manure impacts, and preferred information resources. Using mailing lists and mass media, we distributed the online survey to a broad sample of crop farmers, animal feeding operation managers, and public and private sector advisors in the United States and Canada (n = 709 responses). In addition to computing descriptive statistics, we examined associations between participant role and years of experience with response choices using cumulative logistic and log-binomial models. Overall, respondents rated manure as highly beneficial to crop yields, soil fertility, soil physical properties, and soil biological properties, but shared mixed perceptions regarding the impacts of manure on environmental quality. The most frequently identified barriers to manure use were (1) the cost of manure transportation and land application, (2) odors and air quality impairment, and (3) the timeliness of manure application. Respondents reported they were likely to use scientific information sources and their professional networks in making manure nutrient management decisions. Additionally, we found that role and years of professional experience were often associated with response choices, illustrating distinct extension and education needs of different stakeholder segments. Our results indicated wide recognition of manure benefits to crop yields and soil properties and suggested that practical barriers may often limit manure use."
