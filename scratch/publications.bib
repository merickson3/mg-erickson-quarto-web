	abstract = {This study evaluates the effectiveness of utility-value reflections designed to improve the interest of introductory animal science students. Building on previous work, this research discusses intervention logistics and illustrates the relationships among the intervention, precourse interest, interest during the semester, and course performance.
          , 
            In addition to stimulating interest through experiential means, educators can support interest development through structured reflection. Our randomized controlled intervention study assessed the effectiveness of 10-minute written utility-value reflections designed to enhance the interest of introductory animal science students. During the Spring 2019 semester, we randomly assigned participating students into two blocks, utility-value reflection ( n = 39) and control ( n = 34), at the beginning of the course. In week 6 during the 16-week semester, students completed corresponding tasks: either written reflections on the personal value of course laboratory material or a control picture-summarization task. Results showed that the utility-value reflection intervention tended to improve situational interest and was most effective for students with low pretest individual interest. Neither the intervention nor the interest variable predicted course performance. In utility-value reflection responses, we catalogued themes aligned with a range of task-value components beyond utility-value. Our results reinforce previous work indicating that utility-value reflections support low individual interest students in developing academic motivation.},

	abstract = {Limited research has examined the interaction between dietary crude protein (CP) level and CP feeding pattern. We tested CP level (low protein [LP], 13.8\%; high protein [HP], 15.5\% CP, dry matter [DM] basis) and CP feeding pattern (OF = oscillating, SF = static) using a 2 × 2 factorial in 16 mid- to late-lactation Holsteins (initially 128 $\pm$ 12 d in milk; mean $\pm$ SD). Cows ate total mixed rations formulated by exchanging soy hulls and ground corn with solvent soybean meal to keep constant ratios of neutral detergent fiber to starch (1.18:1), rumen-degradable protein to CP (0.61:1), and forage-to-concentrate (1.5:1) in DM. The OF treatments alternated diets every 48 h to vary CP above and below the mean CP level (OF-LP = 13.8\% $\pm$ 1.8\%; OF-HP = 15.5\% $\pm$ 1.8\% CP [DM basis]) whereas diets were constant in SF (SF-LP = 13.8\%; SF-HP = 15.5\% CP [DM basis]). In four 28-d periods, 8 rumen-cannulated and 8 noncannulated cows formed 2 Latin rectangles. On d 25 to 28 of each period, each cow's feed intake and milk production were recorded, and samples were taken of orts (1×/d) and milk (2×/d). We fit linear mixed models with fixed CP level, CP feeding pattern, and period effects, and a random intercept for cow, computing least squares means and standard errors. Neither CP level, CP feeding pattern, nor the interaction affected DM intake, feed efficiency, or production of milk, fat- and protein-corrected milk (FPCM), fat, true protein, or lactose. Milk urea-N (MUN) yield was lesser for LP. The LP and OF conditions decreased MUN concentration. The CP level tended to interact with CP feeding pattern so that milk protein concentration was greatest for OF-HP. The OF and LP conditions increased the ratio of true protein to MUN yield. Within OF, cosinor mixed models of selected variables showed that cows maintained production of FPCM across dietary changes, but MUN followed a wave-pattern at a 2-d delay relative to dietary changes. A tendency for lesser MUN with OF contradicted prior research and suggested potential differences in urea-N metabolism between OF and SF. Results showed that cows maintained production of economically-relevant components regardless of CP feeding pattern and CP level. Contrary to our hypothesis, the effects of 48-h oscillating CP were mostly consistent across CP levels, suggesting that productivity is resilient to patterned variation in dietary CP over time even when average CP supply is low (13.8\% of DM) and despite 48 h restrictions at 12.2\% CP.},

@article{santos_retrospective_2023,
	abstract = {In 2019 a global pandemic forced biology teaching laboratories to move remotely. In this article we present data on student perceptions of laboratory instruction modality as experienced pre-, during, and post-pandemic. Our research took place at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2022. We designed a survey to evaluate students' perception of key components of scientific critical thinking set as learning outcomes of the laboratory of an introductory biology course. Participants included students who took the course under the same teaching assistant. We surveyed four consecutive semesters in which teaching and learning environments were drastically altered: A) pre-pandemic in-person instruction Fall 2019, B) pandemic emergency-remote instruction Spring 2020, C) pandemic full-semester online instruction Fall 2020, and D) post-pandemic return to in-person instruction Spring 2021. We found differences in the response to four of the nine survey items. First, greater ratings were observed for D (post-pandemic in-person Spring 2021) relative to C (pandemic full-semester online Fall 2020) for the following three items: (a) developing research questions and hypotheses, (b) performing experiments and (c) level of engagement. Furthermore, the rating for the overall laboratory quality was greater for D (post-pandemic in-person Spring 2021) relative to A (pre-pandemic in-person Fall 2019). There were no differences in students' perception for the following four items: presenting data, performing statistical analysis, discussion of results, and acquiring critical thinking skills. We concluded that students had a better appreciation for in-person laboratories after experiencing remote laboratory. In the future, student perceptions should be considered, along with their academic experiences, whenever laboratory teaching is done remotely. \&nbsp;},

@article{erickson_crude_2024,
	abstract = {Reducing dietary crude protein (CP) is a well-established means to improve N use efficiency. Yet, few studies have considered if transient restrictions in dietary CP could reduce the environmental footprint of late lactation cows. We hypothesized that the effects of CP feeding pattern on digestibility and environmental outputs would be amplified at lower dietary CP. We tested CP levels below and near predicted requirements (LP, 13.8\%; HP, 15.5\%) offered in 2 feeding patterns: where diets alternated $\pm$ 1.8 percentage units CP every 2 d (oscillating; OF) or remained static (SF). Our study used a 2x2 factorial design with 16 mid- to late-lactation Holsteins (M = 128, SD = 12 DIM), divided into rumen-cannulated (n = 8) and non-cannulated subsets (n = 8). For each 28-d experimental period, we recorded feed intake and milk production and took samples of orts (1x/d) and milk (2x/d) for 4 d. For the cannulated subset, we measured and sampled from the total mass of feces and urine production and collected plasma 2x/d across 4 d. For the non-cannulated subset, we sampled carbon dioxide and methane emissions 3x/d for 4 d. For each subset, we fit linear mixed models with fixed effects for CP level, CP feeding pattern, the interaction of CP level and CP feeding pattern, period, and a random effect for cow. For plasma and urinary urea-N, we conducted time series analysis. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found no evidence that dietary CP level and CP feeding pattern interacted to influence N balance, nutrient digestibility, or gas emissions. Results showed HP resulted in similar milk N but increased manure N, reducing N use efficiency (milk true protein N/intake N) relative to LP. For OF, urea-N in urine and plasma peaked 46--52 h after the first higher-CP phase feeding. Nutrient digestibility and gas emissions were similar across treatments, except CO2 production was greater for OF-HP. In summary, measured variables were minimally affected by dietary CP alternating $\pm$ 1.8 percentage units every 48 h, even when average dietary CP was fed below predicted requirements (LP). Although our findings suggest that mid- to late-lactation cows are resilient to oscillation in dietary CP, oscillating CP neither reduced the environmental footprint by improving nutrient use efficiencies nor reduced the potential for direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions.},

Groups of five to seven students were assigned learning activities as treatments in a Latin Square design consisting of three experimental periods. At the beginning of selected laboratory sessions, students completed 10 minutes of the experimental activity immediately followed by a questionnaire. Students rated hands-on, problem-based laboratory stations as more challenging, novel, and attention-grabbing than they rated case studies or video lectures. Interest, intrinsic motivation, and behavioral engagement were greatest for groups completing laboratory stations followed by those completing case studies and lectures, respectively. Overall, the greater situational interest experienced during laboratory stations and case studies indicates that these activities can be leveraged to create learning environments that promote interest, engagement, and achievement.},

@article{pizarro_agroecological_2025,
	abstract = {CONTEXT
In Peru, silvopastoral systems have been included as a national measure to address deforestation and mitigate carbon emissions. Limited studies have assessed the sustainability of mixed livestock-crop systems using tools that address multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).
OBJECTIVE
We assessed the sustainability of smallholder dairy farms in the Peruvian Amazon as affected by system type (silvopastoral or conventional) and herd size (medium or large) using the Tool for Agroecological Performance Evaluation (TAPE). Furthermore, we explored the linkages among TAPE indicators including the 10 Elements of Agroecology (EA), an overall evaluation scale (Characterization of Agroecological Transition; CAET), and 11 SDG-linked Core Criteria of Performance (CCP).
METHODS
Twenty-two farmers of the San Martin region were surveyed. Data were subjected to analysis of variance, Pearson correlations, and fitted to linear and quadratic functions.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Silvopastoral systems showed a greater agroecological transition than conventional systems (69.0 vs. 60.2; CAET mean) regardless of herd size. Results suggested that EA and CCP were essentially independent of each other if linearity was assumed. However, concave quadratic relationships were detected between the CAET and 4 CCP: Farm Income, Agricultural Net Income, Dietary Diversity, and Women's Empowerment. For these CCP, depressed values for farms with intermediate CAET (60 to 69) suggested that they neither reap the full benefits of agroecological practices found mainly in silvopastoral farms (CAET {\textgreater}70) nor the full benefits of conventional practices (CAET {\textless}60).
SIGNIFICANCE
The implementation of agroecological practices in smallholder systems may support positive economic and social sustainability outcomes.},

@article{reed_nonlinear_2024,
	abstract = {Few studies have examined the N kinetics of individual feeds with stable isotope tracing. We hypothesized that N partitioning to milk and excreta pools as well as the rates of the processes that drive this partitioning would differ for alfalfa silage, corn silage, corn grain, and soybean meal. Feed ingredients were endogenously labeled with 15N and included in 4 diets to create treatments with the same dietary composition and different labeled feed. Diets were fed to 12 late-lactation dairy cows for 4 d (96 h) and feces, urine, and milk collection proceeded during the 4 d of 15N enrichment and for 3 d (80 h) after cessation of label feeding. Nonlinear models of 15N enrichment and decay were fit to milk (MN), urine (UN), and fecal N (FN) in R with the nlme package, and feed-specific parameter estimates were compared. The estimated proportions of feed N that were excreted in feces supported our understanding that N from soybean meal and corn grain is more digestible than N from alfalfa and corn silage. Estimates for the N partitioning between milk and urine from the 2 concentrate feeds (soybean meal and corn grain) indicated that UN/MN ratios were less than or equal to 1:1, indicating either more or equal nitrogen partitioning to milk compared with urine. It is important to maintain factual accuracy in representing the results rather than implying a desired outcome unsupported by the data. In contrast, UN/MN ratios for forage feeds (corn and alfalfa silage) were {\textgreater}1:1, indicating more N partitioning to urine than milk. The modeled proportion of total FN that originated from feed N was 82.2\%, which is in line with previous research using a similar 15N measurement timeframe. However, the proportion of urinary and MN originating from feed N was much lower (60.5\% for urine, 57.9\% for milk), suggesting that approximately 40\% of urinary and MN directly originate from body N sources related to protein turnover.},

@article{erickson_manure_2025,
	abstract = {Using manure as a crop fertilizer promotes recycling of locally available organic nutrients and reduces needs for manufactured inorganic fertilizers. However, the factors that motivate and constrain manure use are unclear. To explore stakeholder perceptions, we designed a quantitative survey assessing potential benefits and barriers to manure use, knowledge of manure impacts, and preferred information resources. Using mailing lists and mass media, we distributed the online survey to a broad sample of crop farmers, animal feeding operation managers, and public and private sector advisors in the United States and Canada (n = 709 responses). In addition to computing descriptive statistics, we examined associations between participant role and years of experience with response choices using cumulative logistic and log-binomial models. Overall, respondents rated manure as highly beneficial to crop yields, soil fertility, soil physical properties, and soil biological properties, but shared mixed perceptions regarding the impacts of manure on environmental quality. The most frequently identified barriers to manure use were (1) the cost of manure transportation and land application, (2) odors and air quality impairment, and (3) the timeliness of manure application. Respondents reported they were likely to use scientific information sources and their professional networks in making manure nutrient management decisions. Additionally, we found that role and years of professional experience were often associated with response choices, illustrating distinct extension and education needs of different stakeholder segments. Our results indicated wide recognition of manure benefits to crop yields and soil properties and suggested that practical barriers may often limit manure use.},

@article{viquez-umana_assessing_2025,
	abstract = {IntroductionUnderstanding how the rumen microbiota responds to varying protein levels and feeding patterns is critical for optimizing dairy cattle nutrition. This study investigated the influence of dietary crude protein (CP) levels (13.8\% or 15.5\% CP of ration dry matter) and CP feeding patterns (constant over time (static) or oscillating by 1.8 percentage units above and below the mean every 48 h) on the composition, diversity, and function of the rumen microbiome.MethodsUsing a replicated Latin Square design, eight rumen-cannulated Holstein cows were assigned each of the four dietary treatments (structured as a 2 × 2 factorial) in four consecutive 28-day periods (with 24 days of adaptation and 4 days of sampling). Rumen samples were collected 4 h post-feeding, and amplicon libraries of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene were sequenced and analyzed to assess changes in microbiome composition. Additionally, volatile fatty acids (VFAs) were measured to evaluate rumen microbial function.ResultsResults indicated that dietary CP level did not alter microbial diversity (p = 0.30), but oscillating diets increased rumen microbial diversity (Shannon index, p = 0.04). The rumen microbiome richness was also affected by CP feeding pattern (p = 0.05), but not dietary CP level (p = 0.27). Furthermore, differential abundance analysis using ANCOM-BC identified CAG- 352 (p = 0.0001) and an unclassified member of the family Acholeplasmataceae (p = 0.0002) as taxa significantly impacted by protein level and feeding pattern, even though their relative abundance was low (below 0.02\%). The functional profile of the rumen bacterial communities was not affected by CP level or feeding pattern, and VFA profiles also remained consistent across treatments, with no observable changes in concentration.DiscussionThese findings support the hypothesis that the rumen microbiome remains stable despite variations in the ruminal supply of dietary CP, suggesting that compensatory mechanisms may be involved. Although oscillating dietary CP concentration might alter the rumen microbiome, further research into rumen metabolic processes and host-microbiome interactions is needed to evaluate if the changes observed in our study are biologically relevant for developing new opportunities to enhance protein nutrition in dairy cattle.},

              The swift transition to remote learning in response to the COVID‐19 pandemic presented substantial challenges for both students and instructors in post‐secondary natural sciences education. To examine teaching practices and student engagement during the emergency remote learning in the Spring 2020 semester, we surveyed 10 instructors and 261 students in an animal and dairy sciences department at a large midwestern university. Instructors reported using a diversity of teaching practices. On average, students perceived high teaching presence and cognitive presence and moderate social presence during emergency remote learning. Student‐reported educational experience differed substantially between courses and explained a significant amount of variance in student engagement and satisfaction outcomes (
              p
               {\textless} .001). Open‐ended responses revealed beliefs and attributions about remote learning that shaped students' interpretations of educational experiences. Results support the validity of the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework for assessing emergency remote learning and suggest future research on modulators of social presence.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Educators often compare quantitative scores on motivational traits across time (e.g., pre‐ and post‐semester), yet few studies have examined the longitudinal measurement equivalence of such traits or described typical trajectories. Our research explored the longitudinal measurement of individual interest in two cohorts of an introductory animal sciences course across four measurement occasions during a 16‐week semester. First, we modified an existing individual interest scale and validated it within our population (CFI = 1.00, SRMR = .02, RMSEA = .05). Second, we established partial scalar invariance across measurement occasions through nested model comparisons. Third, we described the trajectory of individual interest with latent growth curve models (LGCM). Individual interest started high for both cohorts (intercepts = 65.02, 61.06 on a scale from 0 [low] to 70 [high] for Fall 2018 and Spring 2019, respectively). Individual interest followed a curvilinear pattern in Fall 2018; however, no significant shape trends described Spring 2019 data. Overall, our results show that individual interest can be measured equivalently across a semester; however, it follows heterogenous trajectories. Further research is needed to improve the sensitivity of individual interest scales within high‐interest populations and relate heterogenous interest trajectories to classroom experiences.},
