Using manure as a crop fertilizer promotes recycling of locally
available organic nutrients and reduces needs for manufactured inorganic
fertilizers. However, the factors that motivate and constrain manure use
are unclear. To explore stakeholder perceptions, we designed a
quantitative survey assessing potential benefits and barriers to manure
use, knowledge of manure impacts, and preferred information resources.
Using mailing lists and mass media, we distributed the online survey to
a broad sample of crop farmers, animal feeding operation managers, and
public and private sector advisors in the United States and Canada (n =
709 responses). In addition to computing descriptive statistics, we
examined associations between participant role and years of experience
with response choices using cumulative logistic and log-binomial models.
Overall, respondents rated manure as highly beneficial to crop yields,
soil fertility, soil physical properties, and soil biological
properties, but shared mixed perceptions regarding the impacts of manure
on environmental quality. The most frequently identified barriers to
manure use were (1) the cost of manure transportation and land
application, (2) odors and air quality impairment, and (3) the
timeliness of manure application. Respondents reported they were likely
to use scientific information sources and their professional networks in
making manure nutrient management decisions. Additionally, we found that
role and years of professional experience were often associated with
response choices, illustrating distinct extension and education needs of
different stakeholder segments. Our results indicated wide recognition
of manure benefits to crop yields and soil properties and suggested that
practical barriers may often limit manure use.
