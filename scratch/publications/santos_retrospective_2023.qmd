In 2019 a global pandemic forced biology teaching laboratories to move
remotely. In this article we present data on student perceptions of
laboratory instruction modality as experienced pre-, during, and
post-pandemic. Our research took place at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison in 2022. We designed a survey to evaluate students'
perception of key components of scientific critical thinking set as
learning outcomes of the laboratory of an introductory biology course.
Participants included students who took the course under the same
teaching assistant. We surveyed four consecutive semesters in which
teaching and learning environments were drastically altered: A)
pre-pandemic in-person instruction Fall 2019, B) pandemic
emergency-remote instruction Spring 2020, C) pandemic full-semester
online instruction Fall 2020, and D) post-pandemic return to in-person
instruction Spring 2021. We found differences in the response to four of
the nine survey items. First, greater ratings were observed for D
(post-pandemic in-person Spring 2021) relative to C (pandemic
full-semester online Fall 2020) for the following three items: (a)
developing research questions and hypotheses, (b) performing experiments
and (c) level of engagement. Furthermore, the rating for the overall
laboratory quality was greater for D (post-pandemic in-person Spring
2021) relative to A (pre-pandemic in-person Fall 2019). There were no
differences in students' perception for the following four items:
presenting data, performing statistical analysis, discussion of results,
and acquiring critical thinking skills. We concluded that students had a
better appreciation for in-person laboratories after experiencing remote
laboratory. In the future, student perceptions should be considered,
along with their academic experiences, whenever laboratory teaching is
done remotely. &nbsp;
