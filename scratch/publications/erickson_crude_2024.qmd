Reducing dietary crude protein (CP) is a well-established means to
improve N use efficiency. Yet, few studies have considered if transient
restrictions in dietary CP could reduce the environmental footprint of
late lactation cows. We hypothesized that the effects of CP feeding
pattern on digestibility and environmental outputs would be amplified at
lower dietary CP. We tested CP levels below and near predicted
requirements (LP, 13.8%; HP, 15.5%) offered in 2 feeding patterns: where
diets alternated $\pm$ 1.8 percentage units CP every 2 d (oscillating;
OF) or remained static (SF). Our study used a 2x2 factorial design with
16 mid- to late-lactation Holsteins (M = 128, SD = 12 DIM), divided into
rumen-cannulated (n = 8) and non-cannulated subsets (n = 8). For each
28-d experimental period, we recorded feed intake and milk production
and took samples of orts (1x/d) and milk (2x/d) for 4 d. For the
cannulated subset, we measured and sampled from the total mass of feces
and urine production and collected plasma 2x/d across 4 d. For the
non-cannulated subset, we sampled carbon dioxide and methane emissions
3x/d for 4 d. For each subset, we fit linear mixed models with fixed
effects for CP level, CP feeding pattern, the interaction of CP level
and CP feeding pattern, period, and a random effect for cow. For plasma
and urinary urea-N, we conducted time series analysis. Contrary to our
hypothesis, we found no evidence that dietary CP level and CP feeding
pattern interacted to influence N balance, nutrient digestibility, or
gas emissions. Results showed HP resulted in similar milk N but
increased manure N, reducing N use efficiency (milk true protein
N/intake N) relative to LP. For OF, urea-N in urine and plasma peaked
46--52 h after the first higher-CP phase feeding. Nutrient digestibility
and gas emissions were similar across treatments, except CO2 production
was greater for OF-HP. In summary, measured variables were minimally
affected by dietary CP alternating $\pm$ 1.8 percentage units every 48
h, even when average dietary CP was fed below predicted requirements
(LP). Although our findings suggest that mid- to late-lactation cows are
resilient to oscillation in dietary CP, oscillating CP neither reduced
the environmental footprint by improving nutrient use efficiencies nor
reduced the potential for direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions.
