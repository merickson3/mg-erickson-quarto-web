Few studies have examined the N kinetics of individual feeds with stable
isotope tracing. We hypothesized that N partitioning to milk and excreta
pools as well as the rates of the processes that drive this partitioning
would differ for alfalfa silage, corn silage, corn grain, and soybean
meal. Feed ingredients were endogenously labeled with 15N and included
in 4 diets to create treatments with the same dietary composition and
different labeled feed. Diets were fed to 12 late-lactation dairy cows
for 4 d (96 h) and feces, urine, and milk collection proceeded during
the 4 d of 15N enrichment and for 3 d (80 h) after cessation of label
feeding. Nonlinear models of 15N enrichment and decay were fit to milk
(MN), urine (UN), and fecal N (FN) in R with the nlme package, and
feed-specific parameter estimates were compared. The estimated
proportions of feed N that were excreted in feces supported our
understanding that N from soybean meal and corn grain is more digestible
than N from alfalfa and corn silage. Estimates for the N partitioning
between milk and urine from the 2 concentrate feeds (soybean meal and
corn grain) indicated that UN/MN ratios were less than or equal to 1:1,
indicating either more or equal nitrogen partitioning to milk compared
with urine. It is important to maintain factual accuracy in representing
the results rather than implying a desired outcome unsupported by the
data. In contrast, UN/MN ratios for forage feeds (corn and alfalfa
silage) were {`\textgreater`{=tex}}1:1, indicating more N partitioning
to urine than milk. The modeled proportion of total FN that originated
from feed N was 82.2%, which is in line with previous research using a
similar 15N measurement timeframe. However, the proportion of urinary
and MN originating from feed N was much lower (60.5% for urine, 57.9%
for milk), suggesting that approximately 40% of urinary and MN directly
originate from body N sources related to protein turnover.
