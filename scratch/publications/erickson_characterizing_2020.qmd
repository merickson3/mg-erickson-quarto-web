This study examines the interest, motivation, and behavioral engagement
of college students in an introductory course relative to three
instructional formats used in the course: hands-on, problem-based
laboratory stations; problem-based written case studies; and video
lectures. Groups of five to seven students were assigned learning
activities as treatments in a Latin Square design consisting of three
experimental periods. At the beginning of selected laboratory sessions,
students completed 10 minutes of the experimental activity immediately
followed by a questionnaire. Students rated hands-on, problem-based
laboratory stations as more challenging, novel, and attention-grabbing
than they rated case studies or video lectures. Interest, intrinsic
motivation, and behavioral engagement were greatest for groups
completing laboratory stations followed by those completing case studies
and lectures, respectively. Overall, the greater situational interest
experienced during laboratory stations and case studies indicates that
these activities can be leveraged to create learning environments that
promote interest, engagement, and achievement.
