Limited research has examined the interaction between dietary crude
protein (CP) level and CP feeding pattern. We tested CP level (low
protein \[LP\], 13.8%; high protein \[HP\], 15.5% CP, dry matter \[DM\]
basis) and CP feeding pattern (OF = oscillating, SF = static) using a 2
× 2 factorial in 16 mid- to late-lactation Holsteins (initially 128
$\pm$ 12 d in milk; mean $\pm$ SD). Cows ate total mixed rations
formulated by exchanging soy hulls and ground corn with solvent soybean
meal to keep constant ratios of neutral detergent fiber to starch
(1.18:1), rumen-degradable protein to CP (0.61:1), and
forage-to-concentrate (1.5:1) in DM. The OF treatments alternated diets
every 48 h to vary CP above and below the mean CP level (OF-LP = 13.8%
$\pm$ 1.8%; OF-HP = 15.5% $\pm$ 1.8% CP \[DM basis\]) whereas diets were
constant in SF (SF-LP = 13.8%; SF-HP = 15.5% CP \[DM basis\]). In four
28-d periods, 8 rumen-cannulated and 8 noncannulated cows formed 2 Latin
rectangles. On d 25 to 28 of each period, each cow's feed intake and
milk production were recorded, and samples were taken of orts (1×/d) and
milk (2×/d). We fit linear mixed models with fixed CP level, CP feeding
pattern, and period effects, and a random intercept for cow, computing
least squares means and standard errors. Neither CP level, CP feeding
pattern, nor the interaction affected DM intake, feed efficiency, or
production of milk, fat- and protein-corrected milk (FPCM), fat, true
protein, or lactose. Milk urea-N (MUN) yield was lesser for LP. The LP
and OF conditions decreased MUN concentration. The CP level tended to
interact with CP feeding pattern so that milk protein concentration was
greatest for OF-HP. The OF and LP conditions increased the ratio of true
protein to MUN yield. Within OF, cosinor mixed models of selected
variables showed that cows maintained production of FPCM across dietary
changes, but MUN followed a wave-pattern at a 2-d delay relative to
dietary changes. A tendency for lesser MUN with OF contradicted prior
research and suggested potential differences in urea-N metabolism
between OF and SF. Results showed that cows maintained production of
economically-relevant components regardless of CP feeding pattern and CP
level. Contrary to our hypothesis, the effects of 48-h oscillating CP
were mostly consistent across CP levels, suggesting that productivity is
resilient to patterned variation in dietary CP over time even when
average CP supply is low (13.8% of DM) and despite 48 h restrictions at
12.2% CP.
