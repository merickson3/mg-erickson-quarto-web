IntroductionUnderstanding how the rumen microbiota responds to varying
protein levels and feeding patterns is critical for optimizing dairy
cattle nutrition. This study investigated the influence of dietary crude
protein (CP) levels (13.8% or 15.5% CP of ration dry matter) and CP
feeding patterns (constant over time (static) or oscillating by 1.8
percentage units above and below the mean every 48 h) on the
composition, diversity, and function of the rumen
microbiome.MethodsUsing a replicated Latin Square design, eight
rumen-cannulated Holstein cows were assigned each of the four dietary
treatments (structured as a 2 × 2 factorial) in four consecutive 28-day
periods (with 24 days of adaptation and 4 days of sampling). Rumen
samples were collected 4 h post-feeding, and amplicon libraries of the
V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene were sequenced and analyzed to assess
changes in microbiome composition. Additionally, volatile fatty acids
(VFAs) were measured to evaluate rumen microbial function.ResultsResults
indicated that dietary CP level did not alter microbial diversity (p =
0.30), but oscillating diets increased rumen microbial diversity
(Shannon index, p = 0.04). The rumen microbiome richness was also
affected by CP feeding pattern (p = 0.05), but not dietary CP level (p =
0.27). Furthermore, differential abundance analysis using ANCOM-BC
identified CAG- 352 (p = 0.0001) and an unclassified member of the
family Acholeplasmataceae (p = 0.0002) as taxa significantly impacted by
protein level and feeding pattern, even though their relative abundance
was low (below 0.02%). The functional profile of the rumen bacterial
communities was not affected by CP level or feeding pattern, and VFA
profiles also remained consistent across treatments, with no observable
changes in concentration.DiscussionThese findings support the hypothesis
that the rumen microbiome remains stable despite variations in the
ruminal supply of dietary CP, suggesting that compensatory mechanisms
may be involved. Although oscillating dietary CP concentration might
alter the rumen microbiome, further research into rumen metabolic
processes and host-microbiome interactions is needed to evaluate if the
changes observed in our study are biologically relevant for developing
new opportunities to enhance protein nutrition in dairy cattle.
